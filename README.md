## 🔍 Quick Health Check

To verify your setup:

1. Run `Documentation/verify_udp_encryption.sh`
2. Start the game and press F9 for diagnostics
3. Use console command `help` to verify console system
4. Check Unity console for security warnings

**Security Status**: All UDP traffic should show as encrypted in logs. Any unencrypted packet warnings indicate configuration issues.
