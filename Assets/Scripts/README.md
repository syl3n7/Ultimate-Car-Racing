## Key Features

### üîí Security
- **UDP Encryption**: All multiplayer traffic is encrypted using AES-256
- **Session Security**: Secure key derivation and session management
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time encryption status and security warnings

### üéÆ Gameplay
- **Realistic Car Physics**: Advanced vehicle dynamics and control
- **Smooth Multiplayer**: Low-latency position synchronization
- **Camera System**: Dynamic camera following with smooth transitions

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools
- **Console Commands**: In-game server configuration and debugging
- **Encryption Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite for security validation
- **Real-time Diagnostics**: Live monitoring of network and encryption status

## Usage Guidelines

### For Development
1. Use scripts in `Testing/` directory for debugging and validation
2. Access console with `~` key for server configuration
3. Monitor encryption status with F9 diagnostic overlay

### For Production
1. Consider removing or securing `Console/` and `Testing/` directories
2. Ensure all network traffic uses encryption (check logs for warnings)
3. Validate server connection settings before deployment

## Dependencies

- **Unity 2022.3+** - Core Unity engine
- **Unity Netcode** - Basic networking foundation
- **.NET Cryptography** - For UDP encryption
- **Unity Input System** - For car controls and console input

## Security Notes

This implementation follows security best practices:
- All UDP packets are encrypted
- No sensitive data transmitted in plaintext
- Comprehensive security logging
- Session-based key management
